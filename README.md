A beginning project to help me to understand how to use git-hub
I'm John O'Rourke. I am 72 years old. I have programmed computers in a variety of languages since the 1970's. I learned a lot about programming by taking courses at LA Trade Tech. Then I got a job with a company called MCBA - Mini Computer Business Applications. I worked with them for 5 years and then got a job with GABA - Glen A. Barber and Associates. I then began a consulting company of my own and programmed for Huges Aircraft, Stock brokerage companies and others for a number of years. I retired for a while and did a few different things like driving big rigs across the country. Now I do part time programming and small projects. I became interested in square dancing a while ago and I want to work on a javascript program called taminations to do testing of square dancing knowledge.
